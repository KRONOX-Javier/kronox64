# KRONOX

**KRONOX** is a minimalist, modular and deterministic microkernel written in **Assembly**, **C**, and **Rust**. It is designed for x86_64 systems and aims to serve as an educational and experimental platform for low-level system development.

## âœ¦ Philosophy

Inspired by the Titan of Time, KRONOX seeks to bring total control over execution flow, strict process isolation, and real-time precision to system architecture. Every layer is engineered to prioritize clarity, performance, and simplicity.

> "KRONOX: Time under your command."

## ðŸ”§ Built With

- **x86_64 Assembly** â€” For early boot stages, interrupts, and hardware setup.
- **C** â€” For kernel core logic, memory management, and drivers.
- **Rust** â€” For safe, modern abstractions over low-level operations.

## ðŸš€ Features (Work in Progress)

- Minimal bootloader and kernel initialization
- Physical and virtual memory manager
- Task/process management with future scheduler
- Isolated drivers as dynamically loadable modules
- Clean syscall interface
- Logging and debugging tools
